# Connect-4

This is 2 player version of the very popular connect 4 game made for a school project

The GUI isn't the best looking but it is fully functional and works well

It is writen in c# using visual studio

In order to run it you will need to edit the path of the pictures so that it corresponds to that of your path.

After compile the program and run the exe file which should be located within the bin folder and have fun playing connect 4
